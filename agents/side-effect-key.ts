/**
 * Phase 5 (v2.4.0) — Side-effect key derivation.
 *
 * When a ReAct turn emits multiple tool calls, we want to run them
 * concurrently for speed, BUT two calls that touch the same shared
 * resource must be serialized. The scheduler groups calls by
 * sideEffectKey and runs one group in parallel but within-group in
 * sequence.
 *
 *   - Pure reads (file_read, web_fetch, web_search, system_info,
 *     process_list, file_list, file_search, get_current_time,
 *     screenshot) → no key (fully parallel-safe).
 *
 *   - file_write → key is `file_write:<normalized-path>`. Two writes to
 *     the SAME path serialize; writes to DIFFERENT paths remain parallel.
 *
 *   - shell_execute, code_execute → key 'exec'. We do not know what a
 *     shell command touches, so batch all exec-class calls onto a single
 *     queue.
 *
 *   - image_generate, video_generate, run_workflow → key 'comfyui'. ComfyUI
 *     serializes internally and workflows do heavy I/O; running in parallel
 *     provides no win and competes for the GPU + the VRAM hand-off.
